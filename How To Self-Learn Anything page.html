                        <h2>How To Self-Learn Anything: Must-Have Self-Learning Tools To Become An Expert In Anything (Self-Learning Mastery)</h2>
                        <span>Paperback – February 1, 2023</span>
                        <p><i>by Thinknetic (Author)</i></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Different people learn differently. Here’s how to create a learning system that’s right for you.</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Author, entrepreneur, and motivational speaker, Jim Rohn said, “Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.”</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Rohn was born into a poor family, grew up on a farm, was a millionaire by 30, lost it all at 33, and regained it again.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>How did he do this? Rohn credits his lifelong commitment to improvement through self-learning.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Rohn only did a year of college before dropping out, frustrated that he wasn’t learning what he wanted.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It’s a common complaint leveled against the formal education system. Schools don’t teach people what’s important.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Public School Review (an organization that profiles and ranks US public schools) says one of the biggest challenges with the system is an obsession with standardized testing.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Schools emphasize the teach-to-the-test approach while reducing focus on non-tested subjects.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Non-tested subjects would include things like creativity and adaptability, necessary qualities for any self-learner.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>After 18 years of standard education, you may think that you could acquire new skills the way you did there. Unfortunately, you may be mistaken.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>That’s because standard education taught you how to pass tests. But it didn’t teach you how to think.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This is one of the things this book will help you understand. Other things you’ll get out of this book include:</p>
                        <br>

                                <li>Why this factor may be the secret key to unlocking your potential and mastering any new skill (hint: it's not ability)</li>
                                <li>The right way to read … and why how you read now is wrong</li>

                                <li>Why when coming to learning, fear is the other “F” word</li>
                                <li>How to identify if your "why" is powerful enough to overcome any obstacle in your self-learning journey</li>
                                <li><b>Discouragement… How to avoid the “D” word and why it can mean the death of all learning</b></li>

                        <p>Very informative, encouraging, and clear about various options when it comes to learning anything on your own. Hits the “nail on the head” when it discusses the old, conventional and outdated teaching methods that many school systems continue to use regardless of the statistically poor results.</p>
